Survive/avoid environmental dangers (think of the place itself as the “villain”, it is a monster without HP that "wants" to hurt players or drain their resources, and has certain powers to accomplish that. Traps, cave-ins, lava eruptions, rock-slides, avalanche, collapsing buildings, impenetrable mist, wild animals, dangerous/poisonous flora, falling into a pit, getting lost, etc).
Overcome environmental obstacles (a river on your way, a closed gate, climbing a mountain, a swamp, quick sand, slipping hazard above the abyss, thin ice, wild magic area. Retrieve an item from the bottom of the lake.).
Travel through multiple locations to reach the target.
Explore the location (to learn about it, to map it, to figure out what happened here. To find bandit camps, enemy encampments, monster nest, a way through, resources).
Find a lost location/person/item/treasure/clues.
Scout for information, survey the location/region (ahead of group, enemy territory, monster infested territory, uncharted wilderness).
Clear location of danger (creatures, traps, haunting ghosts, curses, infestation).
Track something/someone, find a trail.
Deal with a natural disaster (storm, earthquake, flood, meteor).
Survival (without food/water, deal with harsh weather, diseases. Find shelter. Repair a ship or a radio. Find a way to get back home.)
Enter a guarded area (overcome defenses, defeat security, sneak in unseen).
Escape guarded location (break out of prison).
Use environment to your advantage (start an avalanche to block a pass, assume the most optimal position for combat).
