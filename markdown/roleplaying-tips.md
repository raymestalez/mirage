### It’s okay to be Weird
Don’t be shy. Assume that everyone is on your side and wants you to have fun. Get out of your comfort zone, try doing a silly voice, act things out.

### When you’re stuck - do the obvious thing
This game is meant to encourage you to be inventive, creative, goofy. But if you have trouble coming up with something crazy or awesome - just do the simple, obvious thing. Nothing’s wrong with that.

### Stay in character
Instead of discussing things with other players as yourself, try to immerse yourself in playing your character, play things out as a scene in the story. How do the things you wrote above impact your character's choices and feelings?

### Think out of the box
Look for unexpected ideas and creative choices. Look for non-combat resolutions. See if there’s a way to sneak past the enemy or talk your way out of a sticky situation.

### Don’t stop roleplaying during combat
Don’t just name the spells you want to use.  Imagine you're writing an awesome action scene for a movie - describe what you do vividly, make surprising choices, exchange banter with NPCs and other players.

### Add emotion, relationships, an opinion
How does your character feel about what’s going on? How do they feel about the NPCs and other party members? Do they have a strong opinion about what's going on?

### Yes, and
Treat the ideas suggested by other players as awesome (even when they may seem silly). Go with it, encourage it, add your own ideas on top. Optimize for storytelling and fun, not winning.

### Be good to each other
Make sure everyone feels comfortable, welcome, and enjoys the game.
